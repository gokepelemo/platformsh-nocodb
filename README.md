# NocoDB - Open source airtable alternative

NocoDB is an open source #NoCode platform that turns any database into a smart spreadsheet. This repository contains a working configuration of NocoDB that can be deployed on Platform.sh with a REST API that can be used as a backend for your applications.

This example uses a PostgreSQL database and Redis as a metadata store. You can also use MySQL, MariaDB or any database of your choice instead by modifying the `NC_DB` environment variable in your `.environment` file.
